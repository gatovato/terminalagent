###A 2D side scrolling educational game for Android


Hello fellow humans,

Here's the educational Android game I wrote over the last several years. It started as an education project for myself, and developed into a way of giving back to the Linux/Android community. I've included the commented source code and the resources in a zip file. If you have any questions or comments on this, feel free to contact me at [shane@terminalagent.com](mailto:shane@terminalagent.com). If you haven't checked out the game yet, check it out at on the Play Store
